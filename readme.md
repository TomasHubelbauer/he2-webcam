# He3 Webcam

This repository hosts a page for use with [He3](https://github.com/slashlos/He3)
as an always-on-top face camera.

This is useful when using a capture card for streaming - there is no need to use
OBS to just add the face camera and nothing else - just set this web page as the
home page of He3 and voila, a face camera that will show up in the stream.
